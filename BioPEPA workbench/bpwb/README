The Bio-PEPA Workbench is a modelling and analysis tool for models of
reaction networks expressed in the Bio-PEPA process algebra.  

Given a Bio-PEPA model the Workbench generates a simulation model
ready for execution using the StochKit implementation of Gillespie's
Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA).  It additionally generates an
ODE model suitable for analysis with the Sundials ODE suite or Matlab.
Thus the tool enables the modeller to switch between analysis via
simulation and analysis via differential equations (or to compare the
results of these) while maintaining only a single source model in the
Bio-PEPA language.

To build this program from source you will need a Standard ML compiler
such as Moscow ML, Standard ML of New Jersey, or MLton.  Edit the
Makefile as necessary to identify your SML compiler and compile with
"make" or "make nj" or "make mlton".
