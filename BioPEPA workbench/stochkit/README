       StochKit version 1.0

StochKit is a convenient tool for high performance stochastic simulations.
This version includes support for stochastic simulation by 
Gillespie's SSA method, slow scale SSA method, tau-leaping method, 
implicit tau-leaping method, and implicit trapezoidal method, Useful 
matlab tools are provided to analyze simulation results. An SBML 
parser is provided using Java. An MPI framework is also provided for 
users who would like to use parallel machine to speed up their Monte Carlo
simulations. 

For documentation see the StochKit User's Guide. 

StochKit can choose to use the LAPACK (Fortran) as its linear solver. 
By default it uses its own linear solver. 

NOTE:
1. Wherenever you use our pacakge, we recommend you build the SPRNG 
in your own computer to avoid conflicts.

2. Please report bugs to stochkit@cs.ucsb.edu. We will reply as soon
as possible. So far we've known some bugs for the optimized direct 
method. We will try to fix it in later release.
