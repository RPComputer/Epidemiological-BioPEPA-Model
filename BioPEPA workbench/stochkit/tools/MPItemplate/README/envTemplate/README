The files here is a demo for users to write their .cshrc.

Users in UCSB can use the dell.cshrc directly for the 
Dell CNSI cluster(dell.cnsi.ucsb.edu), 

If the cluster in the CS department is used, special 
attention must be paid to the gcc version.

Wherever you use our parallel pacakge, we recommend 
you build SPRNG in your own computer to avoid conflicts.
