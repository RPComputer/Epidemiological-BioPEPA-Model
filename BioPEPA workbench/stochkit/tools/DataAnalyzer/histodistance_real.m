%/*  SUMMARY: This function assume the vector contains only integers (or it
%/*           rounds the data automatically). Thus it doesnot require a binsize
%/*           to generate the histogram plot.

% Generates Normalized Difference Area of Two Distributions & plot
%
% Computes normalized "difference area" between two distributions and generates
% a plot overlaying the envelopes of the binned distributions.
%
% Usage: [diffarea, plotdata] = histodistance_real(x1, x2, numbins, title)
%
%   Arguments:
%   
%   x1 -> A vector (row or column) of samples from distribution 1.
%
%   x2 -> A vector (row or column) of samples from distribution 2.
%
%   numbins -> The number of bins (k) into which to group the normalized
%              data.
%
%   title -> An optional string to prepend to the plot title.  A string
%            describing the difference area & number of bins will automatically
%            be included in the title whether or not this parameter is included.
% 
%   Return Value:
%
%     A number between 0 and 2 representing the area of the absolute difference
%     of the two normalized distributions.  The closer the value to zero, the
%     more alike the distributions are.  A value of 2 would indicate that the
%     distributions were completely disjoint, while 0 would imply that the two
%     were identical.
