Functions for the general script

Functional rate general computing:
    ratename + " = [" + expression + "];" <- needs specific model computing of expression, ratename
    can be computed by geneal script 
        warning: not all states need state + category

    Functional rate for specific model script:
    input: what's needed
    output: dictionary with keys being ratenames, values the expression strings

Initial state general computing:
    state + category + "0 = " initial value +";" <- all can be computed by general script
        warning: not all states need state + category
    shouldn't be necessary to demand the computing to specific model script

Model general computing:
    statename + " = " + expression + " + " + expression + ... + ";"

    Model function for specific model script:
    input: what's needed
    output: dictionary with keys being statenames, values list of expressions


System equation general computing:
from first to last -1 ==> state + category + "[" + initial state + "] <*> "
for last ==> state + category + "[" + initial state + "]


TASKS:
1 Find out how to manage state + class states and classless states
2 Write functions and complete the general script
3 Write specific script for the SIRD model
